# Incident Response System

This document provides a non-technical overview of an Incident Response System. The system is designed to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents within an organization's network. It operates on a continuous loop, checking for new alerts, identifying incidents, and executing a predefined response process.

## Overview

The Incident Response System is a Python-based application that leverages various security tools to monitor and respond to security alerts. It is designed to handle incidents such as malware infections, unauthorized access, or other security breaches.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that the necessary configuration file, `config.yaml`, is available. If not found, the system will exit.

2. **Configuration File**: The `config.yaml` file contains essential settings for the Incident Response System. It includes parameters such as alert poll intervals and tool configurations.

## Main Loop

The system operates in a continuous loop, periodically checking for new alerts and responding to incidents. The loop consists of the following stages:

1. **Get Alerts**: Retrieve alerts from various security tools integrated into the system.

2. **Identify Incident**: Analyze the alerts to identify potential security incidents. If an incident is detected, it is assigned a unique identifier.

3. **Analyze Incident**: Further analyze the incident to understand its severity and potential impact.

4. **Contain Incident**: Take actions to contain the incident, preventing it from spreading further.

5. **Eradicate Incident**: Execute procedures to remove the root cause of the incident from the network.

6. **Recover from Incident**: Implement recovery measures to restore affected systems to normal operation.

7. **Maintain Incident Logs**: Keep detailed logs of the incident response actions for future analysis.

8. **Review Processes**: Conduct a review of the incident response processes to identify areas for improvement.

## Tools Integration

The Incident Response System integrates various security tools based on configurations specified in the `config.yaml` file. These tools include:

- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**
- **NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)**
- **Log Management**

## Error Handling

In case of errors during the main loop execution, the system logs details of the error and the associated traceback for further investigation.

## Running the System

The system can be started by executing the provided Python script. The main loop will continue to run until manually stopped.

```bash
python incident_response_system.py
